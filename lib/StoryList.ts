		title: "It's actually weird..",
		body: "Because just a couple months ago I have no idea what web development is except some HTML & CSS and probably don't even want to know about it further cuz once have a hard time just trying to figure out what a <div> is, but things just got slightly different, I decided to find out everything related to web & programming."

	{
		title: 'Finally..',
		body: "Everything seems makes sense now, I left my previous job as a photographer cuz I need something more demanding, also left my recent trial as an entrepreneur that ended up with big failure, the reason behind it's not because I don't trust entrepreneurship but it's more likely related to my financial & experience that's not developed yet"
	},
	{
		title: 'About entrepreneur..',
		body: "Don't get tricked by someone who sell a dream about being an entrepreneur, it's not like what you think, it has way deeper approach, just work yourself until you be able to bootstrap your own business, don't rely on other people unless you know absolutely what you are doing, I'm telling this cuz i got broke from it."
